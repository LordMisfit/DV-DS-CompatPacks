As you destroy Malphas, the Void starts
to destroy itself piece-by-piece. Yukari
quickly gaps you out of that place. The
Void is no more but another placeholder
dimension. Yukari quickly explains that
the reason why it was so easy for the
UAC and the demons to break into Gensokyo
was that someone was already weakening
Gensokyo's barriers. Yukari does not 
know who, but it is up to you to stop 
whoever started the real incident.

"Gensokyo's fate is in your hands, human.
If you don't stop this madness, then
the demons will take Gensokyo for their
own. We don't want that, now do we?
Help me fix this, and you can decide 
whether to stay or not."
