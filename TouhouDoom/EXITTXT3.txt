As you destroy the demonic clones of
Remilia and Flandre, you step into the
portal while glancing at Yukari, knowing
that it is good-bye for good.

You are greeted with a stairway in front
of you, along with a few pillars. Looks
like you spawned in a pit. Time to give
Hell the redemption that they've never
expected.
