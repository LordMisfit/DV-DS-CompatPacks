C1TEXT = The ancient catacombs turn out to be\npopulated with unthinkable creatures\nfrom Hell and the putrescent remains of\npeople raised from the dead by the Mages'\nmystical rituals. Roaring and moaning,\nthey roam in search of the next victim.\nUncountable treasures may be hidden\nsomewhere deep underground, but that's\nsomething you find hard to think about\nat the moment; what you want is to get out\nof here, fast. Perhaps those fiery Mages\ncame here not by accident... wonder what\nthey want. And these portals that throw\nyou around hither and thither among\nthe ruins, where will they take you?
C2TEXT = The picture has become clear. The alien\nintruders are searching the ancient ruins\nfor some artifacts that may have been\nhidden by their distant ancestors, in\norder to join them together and with the\nhelp of  their power take possession of\nthe Universe. You are the one to\nsubvert their plans! Sinking into the\ndepths of outer space on the alien shuttle\nyou ponder how differently yesterday's\nmorning walk among the ruins could have\nended. At home over a cup of coffee, or\nover a few beers with friends at a bar.\nSomething takes shape on the radar's screen\nhmmm... looks like a space station.
C3TEXT = The aliens are over and done with,\nbut what's this? Have you died?\nOr maybe you just dreamed it all up?\nHow nice it would be in Paradise now!\nAn imaginary Paradise... whose flip side\nwill always be somewhere nearby.
C4TEXT = Magnificent! The source of evil has been\ndestroyed and the dead have returned\nto their sarcophagi. There, in the depths\nof the crypts, their  remains will stay\nas a reminder of the mysterious forces\nconcealed within the Universe.\n\nSome day they, too, will dissolve in time\nand become the dust on the roads\ntraveled by the heroes of future\ngenerations.
C5TEXT = Excellent! Hmmm... well, maybe not really.\nEverything seems to point to the fact that\nyou picked the wrong portal. What is this?\nA time sinkhole? Last time you checked\nthe pyramids looked completely different...\nhowever, few people can afford such\na sightseeing trip, so keep right on!\nLet's see sights the way they were created.\n
C6TEXT = Well, this is just great!\nTo pick the wrong teleporter twice\nin a row... now this starts to look\nmore and more like someone's evil scheme.\nThere's only one thing to cheer you up:\nit seems that you have made it out of\nthe past in one piece.
