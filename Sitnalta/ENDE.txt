After the defeat of Zakachi 
Flora returns to the surface of 
Vardorzal and inform the 
Llithran council that it is safe to return. 
As a reward, she is given a home in Sitnalta 
as well as a way back to Zendaria. 
Flora requests that 
portals should be built to keep a 
connection between 
Vardorzal and Zendaria, 
so that both worlds can 
flourish together. 

All is well... for now
