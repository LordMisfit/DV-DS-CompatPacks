v1.0 -> v1.1
============
Changes made by John Romero, Flambeau, Keyboard_Doomer, dew

map1:
- changed the closed state texture of linedefs 2027, 2114 to METAL (DM)

map2:
- mandatory medkit pickup tied to opening the exit wall changed to 10 health bonuses to entice even players with 100+ health
- reshaped architecture of the berserk/soulsphere secret to provide escape from the neighbouring lavapit to the west
- changed the closed state texture of linedef 1835 to METAL (DM) 

map4:
- added key pickups to all routes to telegraph progression better
- swapped action linedefs for eye switches to avoid a softlock scenario where the eye closes but nothing in the map opens:
  eye 1: linedef 2070 swapped with linedef 3910
  eye 2: linedef 3912 swapped with linedef 1362 
- health bonus things 185-196 marked MP-only to enable collecting 100% items in single player

map5:
- swapped action linedefs for softlockable eye switch: ld 286 <-> ld 2352
- added a starter medkit to avoid carryover low health leading to lava deaths

map6:
- swapped actions on linedefs 784 and 3505 to avoid a coop scenario in which players in the west section trigger just the wall close and then all die, softlocking everyone in the start room  

map7:
- sector 198 by the caco fountain hellpit originally mixed one-time wall lower and repeatable door close behaviour, leading to a potential lock-out and an ugly hom on linedef 1195 if the player fell off the rampart path:
  added WOOD5 as upper texture to linedef 1195 front sidedef 1856
  sector 198 floor lowered to height 152, ceiling lowered to 152
  action on linedef 5295 changed to 86 (WR door open stay)  
- following items marked MP-only to enable collecting 100% items in SP:
  soulsphere thing 334
	beserk thing 335
	armor bonus things 350-354
	health bonus hings 355-359

map8:
- swapped action linedefs for eye switches to avoid a softlock scenario where the eye closes but nothing in the map opens:
  eye 1: linedef 337 swapped with linedef 2104
  eye 2: linedef 14 swapped with linedef 1362 
- linedef 339 in start room marked impassable to avoid walking through a grate
- SIGIL_COMPAT.wad adds a DeHacked definition that removes the exit level property from the last frame of spider mastermind's death, preventing unwanted early end of the level, because the spider is considered a boss on E3

map9:
- linedefs 1264, 1269, 1274 in BK lava room marked impassable to avoid walking through grates of the firestick cages

intermission screen fix: (SIGIL_COMPAT.wad only)
- added transparent sprites WIURH0, WIURH1 and WISPLAT, which removes the hardcoded "You Are Here" graphic from the intermission screen, since there's no progression map and you did not in fact blow up Baphomet's nostril

ZDaemon sky fix: (SIGIL.wad only)
- added a ZDaemon-compatible (shorter) sky into dedicated mapinfo (leads to a change in TEXTURE1/TEXTURE2/PNAMES lumps)

mapinfo: (SIGIL.wad only)
- added old MAPINFO lump for classic zdoom source ports (e.g. ZDaemon, Odamex)
