Baphomet was only doing Lucifer's bidding
by bringing you back to Hell. Somehow they
didn't understand that you were the reason
they failed in the first place in this
version of the timeline.

After dealing with this detour in Hell, 
you're ready to face the more advanced 
demons that were sent to Earth, as Xenos
lets you know you might be about to lose
your powers temporarily again...

Oh goodie goodie...!! Welp, time to get a
move on...
